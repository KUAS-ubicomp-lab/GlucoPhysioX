Before:

Now:
I computed all available Cross Entropies between pairs of signals and calculated the epoch-wise cross-correlation/pearson’s correlation between all combinations of signal pairs. In order to interpret the calculation, I compared male and female subjects, as well as subjects with HbA1C levels in the High-Normal (HN) range (5.2–5.6) and subjects classified as Prediabetes (PD) with HbA1C levels of 5.7–6.4. I stated low: 0.00−0.33, moderate: 0.34−0.66, high: 0.67 and above (including values greater than 1.0)


Future:
1) transforming the signal to normal distribution before calculating pearson correlation
2) calculating pearson correlation separted by glucose level
3) longer epoch size - more than 5 mins - to get a more significant change when graining the signal
